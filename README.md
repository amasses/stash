# Atlassian SOFTWARE_NAME

Description of the software

This is inspired by [Hbokh/docker-jira-postgresql](https://github.com/hbokh/docker-jira-postgresql)
but the installation and run process is made in a more generic way, to serve as base
for the installation of other Atlassian Products.

## Instalation

Is best practice to separate the data from the container. This instalation process
will assume this.

### 1. Create a data-only container for SOFTWARE_NAME

Create a data-only container from Busybox (very small footprint) and name it "SOFTWARE_NAME\_datastore":

    docker run -v /opt/crowd-home --name=SOFTWARE_NAME\_datastore -d busybox echo "SOFTWARE_NAME data"

**NOTE**: data-only containers don't have to run / be active to be used.

### 2. Create a PostgreSQL-container

See: [POSTGRESQL](POSTGRESQL.md)

### 3. Start the Software container

    docker run -d --name SOFTWARE_NAME -p 8085:8085 --link postgresql:db atende/SOFTWARE_NAME \
    --volumes-from SOFTWARE_NAME\_datastore

## Running Behind a Proxy

In production environments is a best practice run the container on port 80 and
use a appropriated name like http://software.company.com

In this cases you could also need to run the software behind a proxy, so you can
run other applications in the same host.

This is a common feature of the atlassian images generetad by Atende Tecnology.

See the [Instructions](RUNNING_PROXY.md)
